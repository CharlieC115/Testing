### Project Goals

The primary goal of the Trivia World website is to provide a site where users can visit to test their knowledge on subjects to relax and have fun. The website will therefore have a welcoming, consistant and soft feel to it for the design choices and colours picked.

### User Goals

#### User goals:

* User can easily navigate to quizzes.
* User finds the site relax with a soft feel.
* User has the option to submit ideas for new quizzes.

### User Stories

#### As the site owner I would like:

* To provide a relaxing and easy to use website which allows the user to test their knowledge on subjects.
* Be contacted about new quiz ideas.

#### As a new user to the site:

* I would like to test my knowledge on different subjects.
* Relax and unwind whilst having fun.
* Contact the owner about new ideas for quizzes.

### Wireframes

### Surface

#### Colours

The colours used in this project are as follows:

* #120078 - This colorr is primarily used as the navbar and footer background colour.
* #FD3A69 - This is the secondary colour and is used both for font and as a background colour.
* #FECD1A - This colour is the tertiary colour and is used as a background colour. 

#### Fonts

* Primary font - 'Nunito' was chosen as the charecters apear soft in the way the round at every end.
* Secondary font - 'Lato' was chosen as this is a clear font and will be used for questions and answers so the users will not struggle to read it.
* Back-up font - 'sans-serif' chosen as a back-up font as it's a standard universal font.

Upon creating this project within GitHub I used the Code Institute student template: [gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

### Learning resources and styling ideas

* [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/login?next=/dashboard)
    * Throughout this project I have referred back to lots of different modules to refresh myself on good practices.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    * I have used this site throughout the course when looking for ideas or potential stylings to code.
* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
    * I have occasional visited this site for ideas and potential fixes throughout the course.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    * Throughout this project I have visited this site many times to create the pages structure and give ideas and coding examples.
    * I have also read up on ever class I have used to understand exactly what it will do to the site when used.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    * I have visited this site a few times throughout the course however I have avoided it whilst building this site as I wanted to work out how to do most of the code myself and not just see fixes.
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
    * I have not visited this site recently however this is where I first started learning to code.
* [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/palettes/popular)
